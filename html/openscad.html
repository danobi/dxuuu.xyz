<h1 class="title">3D modeling with OpenSCAD</h1>
</header>
<h3 id="the-boring-background">The Boring Background</h3>
<p>A few months ago I got tired of commuting to the local hacker space
so I bought a <a
href="https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-v2-3d-printer-csco">cheap
3D printer</a> to use at home. Like any good 3D printing neophyte, I
printed quite a few precooked models before getting the itch to design
some of my own.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle ended up being that I couldn’t find good modeling
software o run on Linux. I tried out <a
href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a> as well as <a
href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> but found them hard to get
started with. Eventually I stumbled upon <a
href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> which I ended up absolutely
loving. So hopefully this is the first of at least a few posts where I
dive into some of the things I’ve learned.</p>
<h3 id="spice-holder">Spice holder</h3>
<p>There’s obviously a lot of useful things you can make with a 3D
printer. For my first project, I decided on a spice holder for two
reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>My spice cabinet is a total mess and it take forever to find
anything.</li>
<li>It’s a simple geometry, meaning I could focus most of my attention
on learning the tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the final design for reference:</p>
<p><img src="../examples/openscad/final_render.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<h3 id="a-quick-primer">A quick primer</h3>
<p>I’m not really an expert at 3D modeling so I won’t say too much about
the theory. But based on my limited research, I found OpenSCAD’s
marriage between declarative scripting and constructive solid geometry
(CSG) to be a wonderfully elegant combination.</p>
<p>The premise behind CSG is that there are a limited set of 2D and 3D
primitives such as squares, circles, spheres, cylinders, cubes, etc.
which can be combined with with boolean operators to yield complex
geometries. For example, with the following code, you can take the union
of a cube and a sphere to yield a cube-sphere fusion:</p>
<pre><code>union() {
    cube([5, 5, 5], center=true);
    translate([5, 0, 0])
        sphere(r=3);
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="../examples/openscad/cube_sphere.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>Boolean expressions are not limited to single combinations – they can
be nested arbitrarily. Consider this following example:</p>
<pre><code>module ring() {
    difference() {
        circle(r=10);
        circle(r=5);
    }
}

linear_extrude(15) {
    union() {
        translate([15, 0, 0]) ring();
        ring();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="../examples/openscad/before_extrude.png"
style="width:49.0%" /> <img src="../examples/openscad/after_extrude.png"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<center>
Before (left) and after extrusion (right)
</center>
<p>The basic idea is we first create two rings, one next to the other.
We then take the two rings and join them with a union. Finally, take the
union and extrude along Z axis to create the final binocular shape.</p>
<p>The final other technique we use is a <code>module</code>. A module,
take in the context of C/C++ like languages, is more or less a macro. We
don’t use any parameters in the macro here, but we could have.</p>
<p>Knowing these basics, we move onto the design of the spice rack.</p>
<h3 id="spice-holder-design">Spice holder design</h3>
<p>To start, we create the backboard:</p>
<pre><code>translate([(225/2), 25, 0])
    cube([225, 5, 15], center=true);</code></pre>
<p><img src="../examples/openscad/backboard.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>We translate the backboard a bit so that it’s length is easier to
eyeball on the X axis and so it’s arms are more easily positioned on the
Y axis. Note that OpenSCAD is unitless but my slicer (Cura) interprets
the units as millimeters.</p>
<p>Next we create the arms:</p>
<pre><code>inner_radius = 20;
outer_radius = inner_radius + 3;

module arm() {
    difference() {
        intersection() {
            circle(outer_radius);
            translate([0, 7.8, 0])
                square([500, 41], center=true);
        }
        circle(inner_radius);
    }
}

for (i=[0:3]) {
    translate([i*56.5 + 28, 2, 0])
        #arm();
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="../examples/openscad/arms_before.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>The arms follow a similar design to the examples above. We make each
arm by intersecting two circles and slicing off the end so the spices
can fit. And instead of making one, we make four by using a
<code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>One practical tidbit that we make use of is prefixing each arm with
<code>#</code> to give it a different render color. This is useful for
quickly eyeballing changes to your model. In this case, we’ll be using
it to illustrate the changes from the previous code snippet.</p>
<p>Once we have the 2D arms, all that’s left is to extrude them to the
appropriate height:</p>
<pre><code>module arm() {
    #linear_extrude(15, center=true) {
        // Previous contents of `arm()`
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="../examples/openscad/arms_after.png"
style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>At this point we have a functional model. In fact, this is what I
have printed and installed in my cabinets. However, there’s one small
thing left for improvement: the tips of the arms. The tips are slightly
sharp and could use some rounding out. To achieve this, we’ll use a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKVBJMHivA4">Minkowski
Sum</a>.</p>
<p>Minkowski sums are relatively hard to explain with text but
surprisingly easy to understand with a visualization. In the linked
animation, the basic idea is that the sum of two nodes involves running
the child node around the edges of the parent node and adding the shape
that the motion creates to the parent node. In our use case, we’ll
subtract an additional unit off the outer arm circle and replace the
missing volume with the Minkowski sum of a sphere of the same
dimension.</p>
<p>In code, this looks like:</p>
<pre><code>minkowski_radius = 1;

module arm() {
    linear_extrude(15, center=true) {
        minkowski() {
            difference() {
                intersection() {
                    circle(outer_radius-minkowski_radius);
                    translate([0, 7.8, 0])
                        square([500, 41-minkowski_radius], center=true);
                }
                circle(inner_radius+minkowski_radius);
            }
            circle(minkowski_radius);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>With this we arrive at the model displayed in the beginning of this
post, something that looks a little like:</p>
<p><img src="../examples/openscad/final.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Obviously this is not a complicated geometry. In fact, a mechanical
engineer friend of mine was timed creating a similar model using
professional tooling and it took about 90 seconds for him. Despite that,
I still think this was a really enjoyable process. I particularly love
how the entire language fits on a <a
href="https://openscad.org/cheatsheet/">small cheat sheet</a> –
something unimaginable for industrial grade tools. As they say, a minute
to learn but a lifetime to master. That more or less captures why I
think OpenSCAD is such an elegant tool.</p>

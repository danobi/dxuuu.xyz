<h1 class="title">Setting up a barebones website</h1>
</header>
<p>I had a very specific workflow in mind when I set out to host a website. First, I had no desire to be locked into a specific platform. I’ve experimented with Github pages but it’s pretty locked into Github’s ecosystem.</p>
<p>Second, publication and hosting had to be as cross platform as possible. I wanted to be able to write and publish from anywhere.</p>
<p>Lastly, I wanted writing to be as hassle-free and minimally invasive as possible. This meant I did not want to figure out how <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> or whatever- have-you works. I understand that those tools exist for specific reasons, but all I wanted was a simple setup.</p>
<p>In other words, I wanted something that would be simple, straightforward, and portable.</p>
<p>I came up with the following workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I write a post or make a change to my website. I do this using Pandoc flavored markdown.</p></li>
<li><p>I push the commit to my site’s Github repo. <em>Note, I could use any git hosting service here, including my own</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A systemd timer eventually fires. It pulls down the most recent commits and compiles all the Markdown files to HTML. It then updates my webserver’s hosting directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Some unfortunate soul visits my website and my webserver serves them this junk.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Yes, I hard code links to other pages on my site. It might be a bad idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of inspiration was drawn from <a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu</a>‘s website’.</p></li>

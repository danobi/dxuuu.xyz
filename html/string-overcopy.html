<h1 class="title">Kernel string overcopying</h1>
</header>
<p>While on a long roadtrip the past weekend, I somehow remembered one
of the fun bugs I fixed in the kernel a couple years ago.</p>
<p>A bug was reported to me about bpftrace: somehow there were duplicate
map entries for the same string key. So something like:</p>
<pre><code># sudo bpftrace -e &#39;...  END { print(@) }&#39;
^C

@[asdf]: 1
@[asdf]: 2</code></pre>
<p>At first glance, this seemed like a bpftrace bug. I remember being
confused for a few hours until finally narrowing down the issue to the
kernel. It turns out the kernel had an optimized <code>strncpy()</code>
routine where instead of copying a single byte at a time and stopping
when it saw a zero (NUL), it was doing word-sized strides. This also
meant that there could be extra bytes copied <em>after</em> the NUL.
This actually works perfectly fine for C use cases, but BPF is a
slightly environment and it turns out it <em>does</em> matter.</p>
<h3 id="bpf-maps">BPF maps</h3>
<p>BPF hash maps store arbitrarily sized keys and values. In other
words, they’re completely string agnostic. To simulate a string keyed
map, bpftrace creates the map with key size 64 bytes (configurable with
<code>BPFTRACE_STRLEN</code> environment variable) and just shoves bytes
inside. Since the kernel map implementation is string-oblivious, any
hashing or comparison doesn’t stop at a NUL byte – it keeps going for
all 64 bytes.</p>
<p>Herein lies the issue. The BPF map implementation calls into
<code>strncpy_from_user()</code> which can overcopy. To C string
functions (eg. <code>strncmp()</code>, <code>strnlen()</code>), this is
all kosher. However for a string-oblivious hash table, semantically
equivalent strings can occupy different hash table entries.</p>
<h3 id="the-fix">The fix</h3>
<p>The fix was rather simple conceptually but took several iterations to
reach. Starting from <a
href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6fa6d28051e9"><code>6fa6d28051e9 ("lib/strncpy_from_user.c: Mask out bytes after NUL terminator."</code>)</a>,
the kernel’s <code>strncpy_from_user()</code> masks out trailing bytes
after the NUL terminator.</p>
<p>And since map keys should always start out zeroed, the above fix
solves the issue.</p>

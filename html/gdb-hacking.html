<h1 class="title">GDB hacking</h1>
</header>
<p>This past weekend I spent some time hacking on GDB where the overall goal was to improve rust debugging support. I considered hacking on LLDB but their upstream stance on language support is <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/2018-January/013171.html">fairly conservative</a>. The current state is that they want non C-family languages to be maintained out of tree. Anyone who’s done open source software maintenance knows that’s an enormous burden on a team – to say nothing of a single person. In fact, such an out of tree LLDB has been attempted before but the sole maintainer got a new job and the patches ended up being <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm-project/pull/19">too difficult to rebase</a>. So support was dropped. And that’s how I decided to hack on GDB.</p>
<p>Despite being released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger">over 30 years ago</a>, the codebase is still in fairly great shape. In fact, the entire GDB codebase uses C++11. The current developers/maintainers have obviously taken great care to keep things modern. This is evidenced by the tasteful use of C++11 features (smart pointers, <code>override</code>, limited use of templates).</p>
<p>It took about a day, but I did manage to get a couple small patches out. The only patch worth noting is <a href="https://sourceware.org/pipermail/gdb-patches/2020-July/170140.html">adding support for raw identifiers</a>, a fairly useless but educational feature. My hope is to steadily send patches for at least a little while.</p>
<p>To end this post, I’ll share one cool trick: debugging GDB with GDB:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ~/dev/gdb/build/gdb
$ make GDBFLAGS=./gdb run
[...]

(top-gdb) b print_command_1
Breakpoint 3 at 0xd7374: print_command_1. (2 locations)
(top-gdb) r

<p>The neat part is that <em>something</em> is detecting the gdb-gdb debug and changing the top level gdb prompt to <code>top-gdb</code>. This is quite helpful when debugging changes or tracing code paths.</p>
